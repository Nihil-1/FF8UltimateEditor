"""Frame-by-frame playback of an entity animation sequence: what the sequence will DO.

sequenceanalyser says what each command means; it cannot say what the sequence does over
time - how many frames it takes, which branch a jump takes, when the sound lands, where
the model ends up. That needs the byte-code to be run, not just read. This module runs it,
one battle frame at a time, and returns a timeline a preview can play back. It is the
entity counterpart of camerabake.bake_camera_animation(), and like it, it holds no Qt: the
widget only plays what is baked here, so the playback can be tested without a screen.

The walk is NOT re-implemented here either - sequencecommand.iter_command decodes the
command at the instruction pointer, exactly as everywhere else, so the preview cannot read
a sequence differently from the editor showing it.

The driver (FF8_EN.exe AnimSeq_UpdateEntityPerFrame @0x504290) runs every battle frame:

1. if a background sequence id was set (opcode 9A), that sequence runs first, from its
   start, every frame (no saved position);
2. the main sequence resumes at the byte offset saved from the previous frame;
3. it runs until an opcode PAUSES it - a bare op code < 0x80 (queue animation and wait for
   it to end), A1 (yield), B9 (frame wait), A9 (hard stop), AC. The offset is saved and
   the next frame resumes there;
4. the animation advances by one frame.

An animation of N frames occupies exactly N ticks (frames 0..N-1) and the interpreter
resumes on tick N, the tick whose read reports completion and does not draw (FF8_EN.exe
Battle_ReadAnimation @0x508F90 returns early) - the same timing animsplitter relies on to
chain the parts of a split animation.

What the timeline is EXACT about, from the file alone:
  - control flow: the arithmetic op codes (C0-E5) and every jump (E6-F3);
  - timing: how many frames the sequence takes, and which frame each command runs on;
  - sequence chaining: A7 (goto), A2 (end -> queued/idle), A3 (set base), 9A (background);
  - transforms the sequence writes itself: position (95, E5 0D/0E/0F), Y rotation (E5 17),
    scale (E5 24-27), hidden model parts (E5 20, 81), animation speed factor (E5 2A).

What it CANNOT know from the file, because it lives in the running battle: the C3 reads
of the battle context (who the target is, how far, the random value, whether the attack
hit...). Those are not guessed - they are BattleContext fields with documented defaults,
so a preview can expose them as knobs and show which branch each assumption takes. Every
such read is recorded in BakeResult.assumption_list, so the UI can say "this branch was
taken because target distance was assumed to be X".

What it does not render at all (no assets in the .dat): sounds, particle/fade effects,
battle text, other entities. Those become events on the timeline - which is what matters
for editing anyway, since the frame they land on is the thing that gets mistuned.

      monster's seq_animation_data. Every sequence of the file is needed, not just the one
      previewed: A7 and A2 chain into the others.
    - `animation_frame_count` gives an animation's length in frames - a list, a dict, or a
      callable. That length is what makes the timing real, so pass the model's actual
      animation section.

      when omitted.

      so this is a normal outcome, not an error: the result says STOP_MAX_FRAMES, or
      STOP_LOOP with loop_from set when the whole state repeated (which proves it loops
      rather than merely suggesting it).
    - `follow_chain` False stops at the end of THIS sequence instead of continuing into the
      idle one, for previewing a single sequence in isolation.
    - `as_background` True previews a sequence the way 9A runs it - restarted from its
