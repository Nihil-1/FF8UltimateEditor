"""Which audio-archive entry a sequence sound command actually plays.

The sound op codes (97/98/B5/B6/B8) carry a one-byte sound id whose meaning depends on
the op code - verified in FF8_EN.exe linkedToSoundAnimSeq @0x505AB0 and the flag each
dispatcher case pushes for it (@0x505170-0x5051B9: B5/B6 push 0, B8 pushes 1, 97 pushes
0x80, 98 pushes 0x81; bit 0x80 = check-miss, low bits = global-vs-actor):
  - B5/B6/97 play an ACTOR sound: BdPlayActorSE @0x5015A0 looks the id (0..6) up in
    BattleActorSoundTable.sound[com_id][id] (stru_B8A418 @0xB8A418, int[160][7] of world
    ids), then GetSoundID_ForWorld @0x46B120 turns the world id into an audio.dat index;
  - B8/98 play a GLOBAL sound: BdPlaySy passes the byte to GetSoundID_ForWorld, where a
    value under 10000 is category 0 and maps to itself - the byte IS the audio.dat index;
  - on a MISSED attack, 97/98 substitute the fixed miss sound 0x15|0xA = audio id 31.
    The preview's bake assumes the attack lands (BattleContext.target_was_hit), so they
    resolve through their normal path here.

The actor table lives pre-decoded in battle_actor_sound.json: `actor_sound_slots` holds
the FULL 7 slots per actor (null = empty slot) so a B5 id N indexes slot N directly -
the older `actor_sounds` key (kept for Julia's used-by column) drops empty slots and
would misalign a modded row with a hole in it. Table keys are exe com ids: 0-10 are the
party characters, monsters are 16 + their c0m file number.

No Qt and no audio here: this module only answers "which entry", so it can be tested
headless; JuliaManager owns the archive and the panel owns the playback.
