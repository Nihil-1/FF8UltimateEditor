"""A baked sequence, as something to read: what happens, and on which frame.

sequencebake produces one record per battle frame, which is what a 3D preview needs and
exactly what a human does not: a 90 frame sequence is 90 records of which 6 matter. This
module folds that into the rows a reader wants - "these commands ran on frame 45", "frames
1 to 44 played animation 3 and nothing else happened" - and renders them.

The fold is the whole idea: the interpreter already knows the difference between a frame
that ran op codes and a frame that only waited, so the rows fall out of it rather than
being guessed from the bytes. A row is therefore either
  - an EVENT row: one frame, and the commands that ran on it, or
  - a WAIT row: the frames in between, and what they were waiting for.

Background sequences (9A) are dropped by default. They run every single frame, so keeping
them would give every frame commands, turn every row into an event row and bury the
sequence being read under its own wallpaper; the header says one line about them instead.

The HTML renderer lives here rather than in the widget, next to the fold it renders and
away from Qt, so it can be tested - the same reason sequencecodec.generate_help_html does.
