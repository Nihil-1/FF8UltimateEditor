"""Qt objects die deterministically at the test boundary - never by the garbage collector.

Most GUI tests build a real top-level widget (often with a 3D view) and simply drop it. The
dropped tree is cyclic (lambda signal connections), so left alone it dies through Python's
garbage collector - and PyQt6 (6.11) on Python 3.14 does not survive that: the collector tears
the tree's Python side apart (tp_clear) while destroying its C++ side, destructor-cascade
signals and still-armed timers reach slots whose closures are already cleared, and the process
dies on an access violation with no Python traceback, blamed on whichever innocent test was
running. Python 3.14's incremental old-generation collection makes it worse (a pass can land
mid-event-pump and leave the C++ half alive across slices), but even a full gc.collect() at a
safe point can crash finalizing such a tree. The mechanism and the native stack that pinned it
down are documented in Common/deferredcall.py; the crash showed up as tests/test_single_pane.py
dying mid-run.

The cure is a collection that never lets the GC destroy C++: DEBUG_SAVEALL turns a collect pass
into pure DISCOVERY (unreachable objects are parked in gc.garbage, nothing cleared, nothing
freed), every Qt object found gets its C++ half deleted explicitly while its Python half is
still fully intact (destructor signals fire into live, not half-cleared, objects), and only
then does a real collect reclaim the now inert Python remains. The automatic collector stays
off during tests so the unsafe path cannot run behind our back; per-test garbage cannot pile up
because every boundary collects everything. None of this changes what any test asserts - it is
the same determinism pytest-qt's qtbot enforces by deleting registered widgets at teardown.
