"""Tests for the timeline view (FF8GameData/dat/sequencetimeline.py).

The timeline is what makes a baked sequence readable: it folds one record per battle frame
into "these commands ran on frame 45" and "frames 1 to 44 only waited". What is pinned here
is that fold - that it never invents or loses a frame, that it does not let a background
sequence turn every frame into its own row - plus the two things the rendered pane must
always say out loud: where the sequence loops, and which values were assumed.
