"""Destroying the GUI must not take the process down with it.

PyQt kills the process outright - abort(), exit code 0xC0000409, no exception and no message - for
two things this project did in several places:
  * destroying a QThread that is still running (ToolUpdateWidget started its download thread in
    its constructor and never stopped it);
  * letting an exception escape a Qt slot, which is what a QTimer.singleShot callback does when it
    finally runs on widgets whose C++ objects have already been deleted ("wrapped C/C++ object has
    been deleted").

Both showed up the same way: a test suite that died mid-run with no failure and no summary. A
module built a widget, its fixtures expired, the widget was garbage-collected, and the process
went down during whatever unrelated test happened to run the event loop next - a green run that
looked like a crash, naming a different innocent test each time.

These tests destroy the widgets on purpose, then drain the event queue, and assert the process is
still there. They would have caught both: they fail (by dying) on the old code.
